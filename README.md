## Overview
This project focuses on building regression models to analyze and predict car prices based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, and condition. The analysis aims to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions by leveraging machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains comprehensive details about various vehicles. Below are the columns included:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each vehicle.
- **brand**: Manufacturer or brand name (e.g., Toyota, Ford).
- **model**: Specific model name or number (e.g., Corolla, Mustang).
- **model_year**: Year of manufacture or release.
- **mileage**: Total miles (or kilometers) driven.
- **fuel_type**: Fuel type (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric).
- **engine**: Engine specifications (e.g., capacity or type).
- **transmission**: Transmission system type (e.g., manual, automatic).
- **ext_col**: Exterior color.
- **int_col**: Interior color.
- **accident**: Whether the vehicle has been in accidents (yes/no).
- **clean_title**: Indicates if the vehicle has a clean title (yes/no).
- **price**: Sale or listing price.

This dataset is invaluable for analyzing market trends, identifying pricing patterns, and evaluating the impact of vehicle conditions on prices.

## Methodology
The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Loading essential Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations within the dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance model performance.
5. **Model Development**: Implementing regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing insights and potential improvements.

## Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iammuhammadfurqan/Car-Regression-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the factors influencing car prices and presents predictive models with detailed evaluation metrics. The findings highlight the significance of mileage, brand, and condition on pricing.
